# Fibonacci Sequence in Rust.

- In the main.rs file, the main function takes user input to dictate which number to end the fibonacci series.
- The series is  hard-coded to be start with 0 and 1.

## Update/edit/change the code in main.rs to do the following:

- Instead of taking user input on which number to end the fibonacci series, take the user's input to dictate where to start the series. 
- Do not let the user enter a number > 10,000.
- End the series at 10,000 + 1.
- Print to the standard output the series while the loop.
